 * Project Name: Line Follower Car using Arduino Nano
 * Description: An autonomous robotic car that follows a black line on a white surface 
 *              using an IR sensor array. The Arduino Nano processes sensor input and 
 *              controls two DC motors through an L298N motor driver, implementing PID 
 *              control for smooth navigation.

 * Notes:
 * - Hardware Used: Arduino Nano, L298N Motor Driver, IR Sensor Array (6 sensors),
 *                  DC Gear Motors, Li-ion Battery Pack, Boost & Buck Converters, LEDs, Push Buttons.
 * - Software: Arduino IDE (C/C++)
 * - Setup: Upload the provided code to the Arduino Nano and connect the circuit as per the diagram.
 * - Optional: Adjust PID values in the code to improve turning and stability based on surface conditions.
